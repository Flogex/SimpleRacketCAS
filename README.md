# SimpleRacketCAS
A simple "CAS" in the functional language Racket, made as an assigment for Computer Science Class


It is only designed for and can only derive, simplify and evaluate symbolic expressions (in Racket syntax, but with a maximum of two terms per operation e.g. (* 8 x), but not more like (+ 40 1 1)).
